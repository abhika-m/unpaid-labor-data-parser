# CSE163Project

Overview:

This project uses python to parse through data of unpaid+paid labor and analyze the disparity within genders
for the two types of work. It also creates four visual representations using matplotlib.pyplot.

Instructions to Run:

For this project you will need to run the test.py function as well as the main.py function to see
the analysis. You can run the two files by typing "python" + file_name in the terminal. Once you
run main.py, four figures should open up or be saved to your workspace along with two data frames
and one dtype:int64. The four figures are plots from one of the functions. test.py should only 
print one dtype:int64 and should not give any errors as there are some assert_equals functions in test.py.

Download Data:

You can download the csv files from the links below. There are two test data sets with fake data which are
used in test.py and two real data sets used in main.py. Once you click on the link, right click the page then
save as a csv file with names: 'men_data.csv', 'women_data.csv', 'test_men.csv', 'test_women.csv' respective
to the order of the links below.
